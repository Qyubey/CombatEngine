            // Assign speed to each Section by adding random number

            // Loop and iterate each Section's speed down 1 per loop. Per loop:
                // If Section's speed reaches 0, it takes a turn.
                // Section determines action for the turn based on weighted options.
                // Iterate through each Unit in Section. Disabled or Destroyed Units are ignored. For each Unit:
                    // If morale low, re-determine action for individual Unit (such as escape or panic)
                    // Execute action:

                        // If attack:
                            // Get the target Section and select a Unit within.
                            // For each valid weapon system on the Unit:
                                // Roll for attack, add modifiers, determine if hit. If miss, pass resolution. If hit:
                                    // Assign damage to shields if they exists. Some weapons drain or bypass shields.
                                    // Reduce damage by armour if it exists. Some weapons shred or pierce armour.
                                    // Assign damage to hull/health.
                                    // If attack is severe, damage a Component.
                                        // Severe damage is based on attack damage
                                    // If Unit HP below threshold but above 0, disable it.
                                    // If Unit HP at or below 0, destroy it.

                        // If bombing run:
                            // Get the target Section and select a Unit within.
                            // Execute Point Defence if it exists on target Unit. For each valid weapon system:
                                // Attack function defined above.
                            // Execute Bombing Run on target. For each valid weapon system:
                                // Attack function defined above.
                            // Execute Point Defence if it exists on target Unit. For each valid weapon system:
                                // Attack function defined above.

                // Assign new speed to the Unit.
                // Optional: Remove destroyed Units from Section and place in separate Casualties array.
                // Log result of the turn. Record each turn as it comes up:
                    // Each Section taking a turn.
                    // Action for Section. Action if Unit action differed.
                    // Any hits, and the damage dealt where.
                    // Any destroyed or disabled targets.
                    // Summary of the action.
